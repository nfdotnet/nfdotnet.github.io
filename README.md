## Welcome to the North Florida .NET User Group

Our goal is to build a .NET community in and around the Lake City Florida (North Florida) area. If you are interested in programming or IT administration using the Microsoft .NET Framework, this is the place for you!

Our user group has been on a pretty long sabbatical. We expect to start having monthly meetings again very soon, hopefully late April 2019. Then we PLAN to meet once a month in person and listen to a presentation and generally hang out and meet others interested in the power of .NET framework and supporting IT infrastructure. It is completely free to attend our meetings or join the group.

Everyone is welcome, even if you only have an interest in programming or web development. 

Check back soon.
